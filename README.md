# CS50_Pset2
This repository contains three small programs that I wrote for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science. All of them are written in C. These programs have no connections to each other, and are here just for archiving purposes.

1. Caesar.c 
This program implements the Caesar cipher. It takes one command-line argument: an integer that represents the key. 
It then asks the user for plaintext input, and it outputs text encrypted with the Caesar cipher and the provided key.

2. Vigenere.c
This program implements the Vigenere cipher. It takes one command-line argument: a single word that is used as a key.
It then asks for plaintext input, and it outputs text encrypted with the Vigenere cipher and the provided key.

3. Crack.c
This was an excercise for people who were more comfortable with programming. It is a program that can be used to decrypt hashes that were created with the DES encryption standard. Only works on hashes made with up to (and including) 5 alphabetical characters.
